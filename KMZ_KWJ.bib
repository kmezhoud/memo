abstract = {Advances in web technologies now allow direct visualization of imaging data sets without necessitating the download of large file sets or the installation of software. This allows centralization of file storage and facilitates image review and analysis. XNATView is a light framework recently developed in our lab to visualize DICOM images stored in The Extensible Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit (XNAT). It consists of a PyXNAT-based framework to wrap around the REST API and query the data in XNAT. XNATView was developed to simplify quality assurance, help organize imaging data, and facilitate data sharing for intra- and inter-laboratory collaborations. Its zero-footprint design allows the user to connect to XNAT from a web browser, navigate through projects, experiments, and subjects, and view DICOM images with accompanying metadata all within a single viewing instance.},

abstract = {Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in females worldwide. The disease can be cured if the patient is diagnosed in the pre-cancerous lesion stage or earlier. A common physical examination technique widely used in the screening is Papanicolaou test or Pap test. In this research, a method for automatic cervical cancer cell segmentation and classification is proposed. A single-cell image is segmented into nucleus, cytoplasm, and background, using the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering technique. Four cell classes in the ERUDIT and LCH datasets, i.e., normal, low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are considered. The 2-class problem can be achieved by grouping the last 3 classes as one abnormal class. Whereas, the Herlev dataset consists of 7 cell classes, i.e., superficial squamous, intermediate squamous, columnar, mild dysplasia, moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ. These 7 classes can also be grouped to form a 2-class problem. These 3 datasets were tested on 5 classifiers including Bayesian classifier, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), artificial neural networks (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM). For the ERUDIT dataset, ANN with 5 nucleus-based features yielded the accuracies of 96.20{\%} and 97.83{\%} on the 4-class and 2-class problems, respectively. For the Herlev dataset, ANN with 9 cell-based features yielded the accuracies of 93.78{\%} and 99.27{\%} for the 7-class and 2-class problems, respectively. For the LCH dataset, ANN with 9 cell-based features yielded the accuracies of 95.00{\%} and 97.00{\%} for the 4-class and 2-class problems, respectively. The segmentation and classification performances of the proposed method were compared with that of the hard C-means clustering and watershed technique. The results show that the proposed automatic approach yields very good performance and is better than its counterparts.},

Our team won both competitions in the grand challenge, obtaining an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.925 for the task of whole slide image classification and a score of 0.7051 for the tumor localization task. A pathologist independently reviewed the same images, obtaining a whole slide image classification AUC of 0.966 and a tumor localization score of 0.733. Combining our deep learning system's predictions with the human pathologist's diagnoses increased the pathologist's AUC to 0.995, representing an approximately 85 percent reduction in human error rate. These results demonstrate the power of using deep learning to produce significant improvements in the accuracy of pathological diagnoses.},

abstract = {Breast cancer is the leading type of malignant tumor observed in women and the effective treatment depends on its early diagnosis. Diagnosis from histopathological images remains the "gold standard" for breast cancer. The complexity of breast cell histopathology (BCH) images makes reliable segmentation and classification hard. In this paper, an automatic quantitative image analysis technique of BCH images is proposed. For the nuclei segmentation, top-bottom hat transform is applied to enhance image quality. Wavelet decomposition and multi-scale region-growing (WDMR) are combined to obtain regions of interest (ROIs) thereby realizing precise location. A double-strategy splitting model (DSSM) containing adaptive mathematical morphology and Curvature Scale Space (CSS) corner detection method is applied to split overlapped cells for better accuracy and robustness. For the classification of cell nuclei, 4 shape-based features and 138 textural features based on color spaces are extracted. Optimal feature set is obtained by support vector machine (SVM) with chain-like agent genetic algorithm (CAGA). The proposed method was tested on 68 BCH images containing more than 3600 cells. Experimental results show that the mean segmentation sensitivity was 91.53{\%} (±4.05{\%}) and specificity was 91.64{\%} (±4.07{\%}). The classification performance of normal and malignant cell images can achieve 96.19{\%} (±0.31{\%}) for accuracy, 99.05{\%} (±0.27{\%}) for sensitivity and 93.33{\%} (±0.81{\%}) for specificity.},

abstract = {Objective: The primary objective of this research work is to develop a novel benchmark database of digitized and calibrated, cervical cells obtained from slides of Papanicolaou smear test, which is done for screening of cervical cancer. This database can serve as a potential tool for designing, developing, training, testing and validating various Artificial intelligence based systems for prognosis of cervical cancer by characterization and classification of Papanicolaou smear images. The database can also be used by other researchers for comparative analysis of working efficiencies of various machine learning and image processing algorithms. The database can be obtained by sending a request to the corresponding author. Besides developing a rich machine learning database we have also presented a novel artificial intelligence based hybrid ensemble technique for efficient screening of cervical cancer by automated analysis of Papanicolaou smear images. 
Methodology: The correct and timely diagnosis of cervical cancer is one of the major problems in the medical world. From the literature it has been found that different pattern recognition techniques can help them to improve in this domain. Papanicolaou smear (also referred to as Pap smear) is a microscopic examination of samples of human cells scraped from the lower, narrow part of the uterus, called cervix. A sample of cells after being stained by using Papanicolaou method is analyzed under microscope for the presence of any unusual developments indicating any precancerous and potentially precancerous developments. Abnormal findings, if observed are subjected to further precise diagnostic subroutines. Examining the cell images for abnormalities in the cervix provides grounds for provision of prompt action and thus reducing incidence and deaths from cervical cancer. It is the most popular technique used for screening of cervical cancer. Pap smear test, if done with a regular screening programs and proper follow-up, can reduce cervical cancer mortality by up to 80{\%} . The contribution of this paper is that we have created a rich machine learning database of quantitatively profiled and calibrated cervical cells obtained from Papsmear test slides. The database so created consists of data of about 200 clinical cases (8091 cervical cells), which have been obtained from multiple health care centers, so as to ensure diversity in data. The slides were processed using a multi-headed digital microscope and images of cervical cells were obtained, which were passed through various data preprocessing subroutines. After preprocessing the cells were morphologically profiled and scaled to obtain separate quantitative measurements of various features of cytoplasm and nucleus respectively. The cells in the database were carefully classified in different corresponding classes according to latest 2001-Bethesda system of classification, by technicians. In addition to this, we have also pioneered to apply a novel hybrid ensemble system to this database in order to evaluate the effectiveness of both novel database and novel hybrid ensemble technique to screen cervical cancer by categorization of Pap smear data. The paper also presents a comparative analysis of multiple artificial intelligence based classification algorithms for prognosis of cervical cancer. 
Results: For evaluating the effectiveness and correctness of the digital database prepared in this work, authors implemented this database for training, testing and validating fifteen different artificial intelligence based machine learning algorithms. All algorithms trained with this database presented commendable efficiency in screening of cervical cancer. For two-class problem all the algorithms trained with the digital database showed the efficiencies in range of about 93-95{\%} while as in case of multi class problem algorithms expressed the efficiencies in the range of about 69-78{\%}. The results indicate that the novel digital database prepared in this work can be efficiently used for developing new machine learning based techniques for automated screening of cervical cancer. The results also indicate that hybrid ensemble technique is an efficient method for classification of pap-smear images and hence can be effectively used for diagnosis of cervical cancer. Among all the algorithms implemented, the hybrid ensemble approach outperformed and expressed an efficiency of about 98{\%} for 2-class problem and about 86{\%} for 7-class problem. The results when compared with the all the standalone classifiers were significantly better for both twoclass and multi-class problems.},

@article{DiMaggio2008a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The analysis of large-scale data sets via clustering techniques is utilized in a number of applications. Biclustering in particular has emerged as an important problem in the analysis of gene expression data since genes may only jointly respond over a subset of conditions. Biclustering algorithms also have important applications in sample classification where, for instance, tissue samples can be classified as cancerous or normal. Many of the methods for biclustering, and clustering algorithms in general, utilize simplified models or heuristic strategies for identifying the "best" grouping of elements according to some metric and cluster definition and thus result in suboptimal clusters.

RESULTS: In this article, we present a rigorous approach to biclustering, OREO, which is based on the Optimal RE-Ordering of the rows and columns of a data matrix so as to globally minimize the dissimilarity metric. The physical permutations of the rows and columns of the data matrix can be modeled as either a network flow problem or a traveling salesman problem. Cluster boundaries in one dimension are used to partition and re-order the other dimensions of the corresponding submatrices to generate biclusters. The performance of OREO is tested on (a) metabolite concentration data, (b) an image reconstruction matrix, (c) synthetic data with implanted biclusters, and gene expression data for (d) colon cancer data, (e) breast cancer data, as well as (f) yeast segregant data to validate the ability of the proposed method and compare it to existing biclustering and clustering methods.

CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that this rigorous global optimization method for biclustering produces clusters with more insightful groupings of similar entities, such as genes or metabolites sharing common functions, than other clustering and biclustering algorithms and can reconstruct underlying fundamental patterns in the data for several distinct sets of data matrices arising in important biological applications.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to evaluate the cytomorphologic features of histologically confirmed uterine papillary serous carcinomas (UPSC) of the endometrium. We reviewed cervicovaginal smears from 12 patients with UPSC who had done their cervical smears at six months to a year earlier before the time of diagnosis; nine smears (75{\%}) were diagnosed as positive for malignancy and three smears (25{\%}) were diagnosed as negative. The cervical smears of patients with UPSC revealed frequent papillary clusters that were composed of large pleomorphic tumor cells with prominent nucleoli in a background of necrosis. Other findings revealed from the tests were relatively frequent single malignant cells and bare nuclei. Although the Pap smear is not a sensitive screening test for endometrial carcinoma, we could depend on it to reveal the cytologic features of UPSC which are fairly characteristic and reliable for a preoperative diagnosis of UPSC. Preoperative identification of this poor prognostic variant of endometrial carcinoma may influence the surgical management of these cases and the choice of adjuvant therapy.},
